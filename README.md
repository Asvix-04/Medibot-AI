# AI-Medical-Chatbot
This repository contains python file and necessary datasets required to run the code succesfully. You can run this code on your normal local device without any obstacles as this project doesn't contain any large dataset as far as i am concerned. Feel free to contribute to this project by cloning the repository and then you can make necessary changes to that clone and fork back it to my main repository. Feel free to raise an issue if you find any.

Motto of our project is:-
"Revolutionizing healthcare accessibility: Imagine a world where basic medical information is available 24/7 at your fingertips. This is the potential of AI-powered medical chatbots."

Throughout the whole project python language is being used to write the code and all the data has been saved in csv format to maintain uniformity and make it more easier to understand. 

*Disclaimer*
As we are on developing stage so do not use this project for any actual cause.
