Here's a dynamic badge using [shields.io](https://shields.io/) that you can add to your GitHub README. It reflects the GitHub repo's latest commit status dynamically:

```markdown
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Asvix-04/Medibot-AI?style=for-the-badge&color=brightgreen)
```
